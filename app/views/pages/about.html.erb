        We are dedicated to the makers, the creators, the risk-takers.
        <br>
        We wake up in the middle of the night and furiously write down
        ideas about how to make your online life better.
        <br>
        <br>
        When we're not hard at work, we're hard at play - we're the loud ones
        in the bar, and we're always the ones shutting the place down.
        <br>
        Human communication and collaboration is what drives us, and it infuses
        every feature of gCamp.
